# Battle Ship

## Purpose

The reason this is called "Battle Ship2" is because during my time at Turing School of Software & Design we were tasked with building a battle ship game. It was one of the first projects we did and the one I created with my partner is something I'm proud of, but definitely needs to be "updated" with the skills I've achieved since then.
